# max-value

Write a C++ program to input 6 integer numbers into an array named findmax and 
determine the maximum value entered and display the maximum value as well as the 
index number for the maximum. Your program should contain only one loop, and the 
maximum should be determined as array element values are being entered. 
Hint: Set the maximum equal to the first array element, which should be input before 
the loop used to input the remaining array values.
